# Python-OpenCV-Demo

## About

This is a demonstration utilizing the OpenCV API for Python3 by Jack Farmer
This demonstration was made for CPSC 501 at Christopher Newport University

This demo takes a filepath to a .png, .jpeg, or .jpg filetype and runs a number of OpenCV-specific functions to distinguish the original image from the modified. It then outputs the image to a new file saved in this repository.

## Requirements

This demo requires the following to run properly:
- Python 3.10 or better
- A will to live

## How to use

1. In your terminal of choice, `cd` to this directory (this repo)
2. Run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
3. The program will run until the user enters q/Q to quit or until the image has been processed.
